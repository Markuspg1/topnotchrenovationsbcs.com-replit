# Top Notch Renovations BCS

This repository hosts the source for the **Top Notch Renovations** web platform. The project provides a full-stack application for showcasing renovation services, managing customer inquiries, and scheduling consultations for clients in the Bryan & College Station area of Texas.

The application code lives inside the `RenovatePro` directory and uses:

- React 18 with TypeScript for the frontend
- Express.js with TypeScript for the backend
- PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for data storage
- Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for styling

## Development

```bash
cd RenovatePro
npm install      # install dependencies
npm run dev      # start development server
npm run build    # build for production
npm run check    # type-check with TypeScript
```

See [`RenovatePro/replit.md`](RenovatePro/replit.md) for a more detailed architectural overview.
